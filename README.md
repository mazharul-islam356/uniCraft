# _some necessary notes to assist in understanding my code:_

- I have used React JS, Tailwind CSS and daisyUI as frameworks for this
website. I have created a folder of pages in the src folder, then in
those pages, I am clearing another folder called home. Inside the home
folder, there is all route information including banners and sliders. All
slider images in public folder Banners contain text, banners and
company logos In Slider.jsx I have used React Slider and in
HowItworks.jsx I have done the design as shown in Figma, and below, I
have mentioned the product manager quote and created that section. In
pricing.jsx I have created three different price cards with Tailwind CSS
In Acordian.jsx I have created an accordion with Tailwind CSS FAQ's
questions and answers are there. Finally, I added a section between
Footer.jsx, and footer.

# _Used technology:_
